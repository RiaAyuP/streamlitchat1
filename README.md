# Chat with LLMs with Streamlit

Please update `system` prompt **in the code** for better experience. Easier UI for `system` prompt is upcoming.
1. GPT-4o Mini Chatbot `1_ðŸ¤–_OpenAI_Chatbot.py`
2. Open-Source LLM Chatbot using Ollama `2_ðŸ¦™_Ollama_Chatbot.py` (LLM: Gemma 2 9B, Llama 3.1 8B, Mistral 7B) **local**

## Preparation
1. Prepare OpenAI API key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys). This can be obtained by registering an OpenAI account (the one you use for ChatGPT works) and put some credit into your account (by registering your credit card). You will be charged as you go.
2. Install Ollama in your PC, please read [Ollama Documentation](https://github.com/ollama/ollama).
3. Download open-source LLMs into your PC, in this case `gemma2`, `llama3.1`, and `mistral` with `ollama pull <llm-name>` command. [Ollama Documentation](https://github.com/ollama/ollama)
